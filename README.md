$ curveadm cluster add c1 -f topology.yaml
```

Switch cluster:

```shell
$ curveadm cluster checkout c1
```

Deploy cluster:
```shell
$ curveadm deploy
```

### Mount FileSystem

Prepare client config, you can refer to the sample configuration:

* [cluster](examples/curvefs/cluster/client.yaml)
* [stand-alone](examples/curvefs/stand-alone/client.yaml)

```shell

```

Mount filesystem:

```shell
$ sudo curveadm mount NAME-OF-CURVEFS MOUNTPONT -c client.yaml
